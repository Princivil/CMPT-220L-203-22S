# Binary Search Tree '22

The purpose of this project is to utilize Java programming to build a Binary Search Tree. I created 3 separate files in which the 'Test.java' file is where the user can test my functionality. I did not complete the advanced search section so my tree will focus solely on transverals, manipulations, and various searches.



## Few Pointers
`curr` Current node\
`head` Root\
I wanted to avoid reiterating using `node` as variable or `root` to avoid any confusion while reading through the code.\
In the `Node.file` you will notice there are methods `visit()` and `unvisit()` this was part of my attempt to start the advanced searches but never got around to it.

### Creating the Methods
Each method has comments about my thought process.
